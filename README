                mdebug - A debugger for Cortex-M MCUs
===========================================================================

This is a debugger for Cortex-M MCUs using SWD (serial wire debug) and
(optionally) SWO.  It provides basic standalone functionality including
memory inspection and modification, processor halt, register inspection,
single stepping, breakpoints, etc.  It also acts as a GDB agent, allowing
GDB to control the target device.

Previously it used a custom debug probe board (m3debug).  In its current
iteration firmware is provided for the readily available (and much more
powerful) LPC Link 2 probe board, which is available from Digikey for
under $20:

It provides flashing functionality via "flash agents" which are little
programs downloaded to the target board RAM and then controlled by the
debugger.  Currently agents are included for the lpc13xx, lpc15xx,
stm32f4xx series MCUs and the lpclink2 board itself (lpc43xx + spifi).

Recently it's seem the most testing against stm32f4xx and lpc43xx MCUs.
It has previously been used successfully with lpc13xx, lpc15xx, and
stm32f2xx MCUs.

Everything is either Apache 2 or BSD licensed, to allow for easy,
no-strings-attached, inclusion in your own projects.  Share and enjoy!

Useful Documents
----------------

ARM DDI0337E Cortex M3 r1p1 Technical Reference Manual
  Has useful details on SW-DP and debug peripherals that was removed
  in later versions of the TRM as "redundant" with other documents.


Historical Notes
----------------

The original work on this started in 2011 and has been tinkered with
on a number of repositories by a number of people.  Trying to fold things
back together and tidy up the build system, etc, ended up being a bit of
a mess resulting in Brian declaring "history bankruptcy" and starting
a fresh repository in 2014.

Some random side projects have been removed.  An AUTHORS file has been
added to provide credit for additional contributors to the codebase.

The code base as of the initial checkin, built with gcc 4.8.2 and
binutils 2.24 (http://github.com/travisg/toolchains) is verified to
be able to use a m3debug board to flash the bootloader and app image
to another m3debug board, which then can repeat the process.
