Before you start
----------------

You'll need to build the lpcboot and debugger tools by running make at
the top level first.

On Linux you may need to install docs/99-mdebug.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d
in order to have access to the debugger firmware and bootloader firmware
without being root.  This rules file allows group plugdev access, which
covers users logged in on console (at least on Ubuntu)


Installing lpcboot and mdebug on the LPC Link 2 board (first time)
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Remove jumper JP1 from lpclink2

2. Connect lpclink2 to USB

3. Download the "soft" bootloader via DFU
   (it is normal to get "dfu status: io error")
   $ ./bin/lpcboot dfu firmware/lpclink2-dfu.bin

4. flash bootloader:
   $ ./bin/lpcboot flash:boot firmware/lpclink2-boot.bin

5. flash mdebug firmware:
   $ ./bin/lpcboot flash firmware/lpclink2-mdebug.bin

6. install jumper JP1 on lpclink2

7. reboot the lpclink2:
   $ ./bin/lpcboot reboot

8. LED should blink for ~3 seconds (bootloader) then start mdebug


Upgrading mdebug firmware on the LPC Link 2 board (after initial install)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. disconnect lpclink2 from USB

2. $ ./bin/lpcboot flash firmware/lpclink2-mdebug.bin

3. connect lpclink2 to USB

4. If you get "flash failure", run the step #2 command again
   (without disconnecting and reconnecting the board)

5. reboot back into the debugger firmware
   $ ./bin/lpcboot reboot


Checking firmware version (debugger should show this on connect)
----------------------------------------------------------------

usb: board id: LPCLINK2
usb: build id: fw v0.91 (Jan 11 2016, 15:43:28)
usb: protocol: 1.2
usb: max data: 8192 byte rx buffer


Connecting LPC Link 2 to debug target
-------------------------------------

You can use the 10pin cable with the J7 connector to hook up to a target
board that uses ARM's standard SWD debug pinout.  If you want to supply
3.3v to the target and operate at that voltage, *install* the JP2 jumper.
If you want to operate at the board voltage sensed by the VREF pin on the
10pin connector, *remote* the JP2 connector.

You can use jumper wires from the 0.1" J6 header (see pinout below), but
in this case there is no VREF pin available, so you must *install* the
JP2 jumper and operate at 3.3v.


J6 Header (pin 1 is furthest from J6 silkscreen)
------------------------------------------------
1. 3V3
2. SWDIO
3. SWCLK
4. SWO
5.
6.
7.
8. GND
9.
